## responsive-form__JavaScript

# Description
- A fluid HTML5 page containing a simple toolbar snapped to the bottom and an artistic (I would like to hope so) form that floats in the center of the screen.
- This project was built using only HTML5, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
- The project uses BEMIT (BEM + ITCSS) naming methodology to define the  classes. It gives a clearer purpose to how classes are related to each other along with making the styles and structure orderly and maintainable. It is a wonderful approach to writing CSS selectors. 
Here's two links I found helpful:

   2. https://apiumhub.com/tech-blog-barcelona/bemit-itcss-bem/
- Although simple and with only 2 elements, the project's CSS file maintains a 'Table Of Contents' for ease of use and best practices!
- This project follows Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1
